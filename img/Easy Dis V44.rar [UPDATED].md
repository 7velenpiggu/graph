## How to install Easy DIS v44 step by step?
  
Once you have all the required software and hardware ready, you can follow these steps to install Easy DIS v44:

1. Disable Windows Firewall and Anti Virus on your laptop.
2. Install drivers for your USB-OBD cable or serial-OBD cable and make sure it is set as port COM1.
3. Install / update INPA / EDIABAS using ADS interface, not OBD. Change environment path in Windows to c:/ediabas/bin. Install ADS Setup and OBD Setup. Edit ediabas.ini and change remote-host and port.
4. Install VMWare Workstation using default parameters during setup. Open VMWare and create a new virtual machine with typical settings. Name the VM, select host only networking, enter size of disk as 18.635 GB and allocate all disk space now.
5. Remove the sound adapter from the virtual machine settings. Adjust Ethernet adapter to use VMnet1. Add two additional Ethernet adapters and also assign them VMnet1. Switch to the options tab and uncheck drag and drop from guest isolation.
6. Mount Easy DIS v44 BASE iso file in Daemon Tools. Edit the CD drive of your virtual machine to use the Daemon Tools drive. Start the virtual machine and quickly press F2 to enter the BIOS for it. Set the CD-Rom to be the first boot device. Save and exit the BIOS. The installation of GT1 begins.
7. The installation ends and you are notified to eject the CD and restart the VM, but do not do that yet. Eject the iso file from Daemon Tools and mount Easy DIS v44 Programs iso file in Daemon Tools. Now shut off the virtual machine and restart it.
8. Return to the BIOS by pressing F2 and set the boot order back to default. Save and exit and the VM will boot up. Select 8cf37b1e13
